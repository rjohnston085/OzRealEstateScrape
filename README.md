# OzRealEstateScrape

Project initiated to apply my software and analytic skills into looking for a house while maintaining some interest in software post my career as a software engineer

Goals:
 - to collect data on a daily bases
 - input into a database of sorts (start with a simple csv then move onto SQL)
 - produce graphical analytics using either Matlab or Python
 - some form of report generation as either email or updating presentation
 - have unit tests to maintain code
 - to have this as one of many on going coding projects
